### 👨🏾‍💻 About me

I’m a senior software engineer with over two decades of experience building real-world systems — from early-stage products to production platforms used at scale.

Alongside shipping code, I care deeply about **teaching and mentorship**. I’ve lectured at the university level and spent years mentoring aspiring developers, helping them bridge the gap between tutorials and professional engineering.

Currently, I’m a **Senior Software Engineer at [Sybill](https://sybill.ai)**.

### 🧰 Technologies & interests

- **Frontend:** React, modern JavaScript, UI architecture
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python, Java
- **Engineering:** system design, maintainability, debugging, developer education
- **Curiosity:** the real-world limits (and strengths) of large language models

### 🧠 Teaching & community

- Former mentor at **Thinkful** (6 years)
- Lecturer (University of London external programme, SBCS)
- Active on **Stack Overflow**, where I try to give practical, experience-driven answers
